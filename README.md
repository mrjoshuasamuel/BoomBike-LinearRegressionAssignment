## General Information
- This project involves analyzing and predicting the demand for Boom Bike's bike-sharing system.
- The backdrop involves urban mobility challenges and the growing popularity of bike-sharing as a sustainable transportation solution.
- The core problem is optimizing the bike-sharing service to align with fluctuating demand, enhancing operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
- The dataset encompasses daily rental data from Boom Bike, including variables related to weather conditions, calendar specifics, and user types.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temperature variables ('temp' and 'atemp') significantly impact rental activity, highlighting a strong seasonal influence on bike-sharing demand.
- Yearly data ('yr') indicates a rising trend in bike-sharing usage, reflecting an increasing customer base or growing market penetration.
- The model's R-squared score of 0.837 shows it captures a substantial portion of the variance in bike rental counts, indicating a strong predictive capability.
- CWeather conditions, temperature, and temporal aspects are critical in forecasting the demand for bike-sharing.
